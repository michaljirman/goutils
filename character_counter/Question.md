For example, if I asked 

“write a method to count the number of times each characters in [A-Z] occurs in a string, ” 

I would see their experience with maps, strings, and for-loops. You could expand this question to test a candidate’s 
experience with go-routines and concurrency by having the ‘string’ be a large corpus of text. During the discussion, 
I do occasionally ask clarifying questions about how the various pieces of the language work.
